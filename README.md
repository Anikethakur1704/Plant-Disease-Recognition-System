# Plant-Disease-Recognition-System
This AI-powered application assists farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying plant diseases through image analysis. Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on extensive plant image datasets, the system delivers real-time diagnostics with high accuracy. Designed for mobile use and low-connectivity environments, it ensures accessibility in rural and field conditions. The user-friendly interface allows easy image uploads and displays clear results with actionable recommendations. By enabling early detection and targeted intervention, the system helps reduce crop loss, minimize pesticide misuse, and promote sustainable farming practices.
# Dataset Overview

The model is trained on a robust dataset consisting of approximately 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves, spanning 38 distinct classes. The dataset was enhanced through offline image augmentation techniques to improve model generalization. It is structured into training (70,295 images) and validation (17,572 images) sets following an 80/20 split, while maintaining the original directory hierarchy. Additionally, a separate test directory containing 33 images was created for performance evaluation and prediction testing. The original dataset is publicly available via a referenced GitHub repository.
